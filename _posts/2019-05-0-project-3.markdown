description: Similar to the Navigation Point-Click Game, only instead of using the mouse to control the player, you control the player with both mouse and keyboard. All 3D assets were created by me to add more life into this short game project. The player is capable of sprints and jumps to help avoid any obstacles to get to the end goal of each level.
