description: A cute game made for the ICT GameJam 2019 Winter with only 48 hours to work on it. The theme was "Start with nothing". Created in a two person team with my task doing all the visuals and 3D Modeling. You play as a mischeavious cat who starts collecting things into a ball. <a href="https://ramilhinshaw.itch.io/kitty-poly">Play Here</a>.
